**4. Tech Stack**
   
Microsoft Power BI Desktop — Main tool for designing and developing the interactive dashboard

Power Query (ETL) — To extract, transform, and clean the raw data before loading it into the Power BI data model

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) — To create custom measures, calculations, and key metrics (like total sales, profits, margins, and growth percentages)

Power BI Visuals — Built-in charts and components (bar charts, pie charts, maps, tables, cards) to visualize data

Data Model (Star Schema) — Fact table (Sales) connected to dimension tables (Products, Customers, Geography, Time) to enable efficient and flexible analysis

**5. How It Helps**

This dashboard enables users to:

Monitor monthly sales and profitability trends

Quickly spot underperforming products or regions

Make data-driven decisions to increase sales efficiency

Present clean, interactive insights to stakeholders


**6. Business Impact**
   
Rapid Performance Review:
Decision makers can quickly view total sales, profits, margins, and growth trends across products, regions, and time periods — all in a single view — reducing the need for lengthy reports.

Data-Driven Strategy:
Provides actionable data to help businesses adjust pricing strategies, promotions, and inventories based on which products or regions are outperforming or underperforming.

Targeted Action:
Highlights underperforming products or locations, allowing the business to focus resources (like promotions or additional support) where it’s most needed.

Enhanced Forecast Accuracy:
By analyzing historical trends and growth patterns, stakeholders can make more accurate forecasts and set realistic sales goals.

Risk Mitigation:
Helps identify risks early (such as declining margins or weak sales in a particular region) and lets companies respond promptly.


**7. Actionable Insights (Examples)**

Top-selling products:
Product A and Product B collectively contribute 40% of total sales — suggesting a potential opportunity to promote these products further.

Slow-moving products:
Product C underperforms across all regions — a candidate for discount promotions or removal from portfolio.

Regional trends:
North America shows strong growth (+15%) while South drops by 5%. That signals a need to investigate pricing, competition, or delivery issues in the South.

Margin signals:
Certain products have low margins (< 10%) — prompting pricing reviews or supplier negotiations.

Monthly trends:
The revenue trend highlights a seasonal dip in Q2 — allowing businesses to prepare promotions or campaigns in advance.
